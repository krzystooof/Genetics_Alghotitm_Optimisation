# PTM Genetic alghoritm

PTM optimization is approach to implement genetic algorithm using python. Main goal is to make it work on embedded devices STM32.

### Based on:
To provide deep understanding of algorithm team proceeded to test already working code. Two approaches took place.

- [Neat Python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python "Neat Python")
Development team also took advantage of already written code in python.

- [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "Octave")
Octave software implements genetic algorithms to solve complicated mathematical problems.

### Sources:

Sources were gathered before coding started. It is important to know how genetic algorithms work. Links below provide general overview of this topic.

### Basic schema

As work neared coding phase, a project overview was developed.
